This is a dump of the firmware shipped with the board. As far as I can tell
it is just a simple 'blinky' that blinks the blue user LED.

It was obtained by putting the MCU into bootloader mode and connecting a
FTDI cable to the MCU's USART1 TX,RX on pins PA9, PA10 respectively. In my 
case the cable was on /dev/ttyUSB2: replace with what ever device your
serial cable is assigned to.

The MCU bootloader mode is entered by setting BOOT0 high and BOOT1 low (see
BT0, BT1 jumpers on board) and issuing a RESET.

The following command was used to make the dump:

stm32flash -r DX_380789_STM32F103C8_ShippedBlinky.bin /dev/ttyUSB2

It can be restored using:

stm32flash -w DX_380789_STM32F103C8_ShippedBlinky.bin /dev/ttyUSB2


Notes: 
1. The stm32flash utility seems to mistakingly identify this MCU as a
128KiB flash. It is in fact 64KiB. But the restore still works.
2. The binary file is compressed with gzip. Uncompress with gunzip.
